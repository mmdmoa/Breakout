# Breakout
> A simple berakout game

# Intro

This is a TileBreaker game made with Pygame.

This is a game I made to prepare for a Course I'm going to publish on toplearn.com, I'm filming my coding process and I'm going to use it to make a timelapse that helps me to promote the project/Course.

I tried my best to code as neat as possible, so feel free to navigate my self-claimed masterpiece.
there is also going to be a remake version of this, which is going to be coded while recording the Course.


# Note

A submodule is used in this project so you'll need to specify recursive submodule in your clone command
with --recurse-submodules

# Requirements

You need a python interpreter above 3.9 version.
you also need pygame community edition above version 2.2
you will also need opencv library

to install pygame community edition (aka cool edition), you first need to uninstall pygame with this:
```commandline
pip uninstall pygame
```

and then install pygame community edition with this

```commandline
pip install pygame-ce
pip install opencv-python
```


the project fails in last pygame dictator edition, because of the introduction of FRect's in pygame community edition version
2.2.

if you're on linux you can also do this which is recommended.
```commandline
sudo apt install python3-pygame-ce
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

Here's how the game looks like. There are 7 levels, there is also going to be a level generator. but not for now.
enjoy.
