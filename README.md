# Breakout
A simple Tile Breaker game

This is a TileBreaker game made with Pygame.

This is a game I made to prepare for a Course I'm going to publish on toplearn.com, I'm filming my coding process and I'm going to use it to make a timelapse that helps me to promote the project/Course.

I tried my best to code as neat as possible, so feel free to navigate my self-claimed masterpiece.
there is also going to be a remake version of this, which is going to be coded while recording the Course.

Here's how the game looks like. There are 7 levels, there is also going to be a level generator. but not for now.
enjoy.
