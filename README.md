# Breakout
A simple Tile Breaker game

This is a TileBreaker game made with Pygame.

This is a game I made to prepare for a Course I'm going to publish on toplearn.com, I'm filming my coding process and I'm going to use it to make a timelapse that helps me to promote the project/Course.

I tried my best to code as neat as possible, so feel free to navigate my self-claimed masterpiece.
there is also going to be a remake version of this, which is going to be coded while recording the Course.

این یک پروژه ساده آجر شکن هست که برای اهداف آموزشی توسعه داده شده. از زمان ساختن پروژه فیلم تهیه کرده ام تا تایم لپسی از شرایط واقعی
کدنویسی رو بتونم ارائه بدم.
